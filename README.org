DPS is a new framework for easily constructing efficient deterministic
parallel SAT solvers, providing the delayed clause exchange technique
introduced in [[https://github.com/nabesima/manyglucose-satcomp2020][ManyGlucose]]. DPS-Kissat applies our framework to [[http://fmv.jku.at/kissat/][Kissat]],
a state-of-the-art sequential SAT solver. NPS-Kissat is the
non-deterministic version of DPS-Kissat.

* How to build a docker container for AWS environment

: % ./build-DPS-images.sh

The above script generates ~nps-satcomp2023:leader~ container which is
based on ~satcomp-infrastructure:leader~ container provided by
https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample/tree/sat-comp-2023.
NPS-Kissat is a parallel SAT solver for shared memory
environments. Thus we do not require a worker container.
